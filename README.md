## Steps

#### 1. Data preparation
Place the Whole slide image in Data/WSI_Image/.

Then in a terminal run:
```
./TileScale
```

After running in a terminal, the result will be produced in folder named 'Data/BB_tileout', like the following structure.
```
BB_tileout/
├── TCGA-04-1335-01A-01-BS1.svs/
│   ├── 10_2.bmp
│   ├── 10_3.bmp
│   ├── 10_4.bmp
│   │       ⋮
│   └── 20_11.bmp
│   
└── TCGA-04-1342-01A-01-BS1.svs/
    ├──30_3.bmp
    ├──32_1.bmp
    ├──33_4.bmp
    │       ⋮
    └── 56_11.bmp     
```


#### 2. List process
make two text files 'train.txt' and 'test.txt' file in the folder '/List/'.

The content structure of the text file is as follows:
```
train.txt
│
├── TCGA-04-1335-01A-01-BS1.svs/38_50.bmp,1
├── TCGA-04-1342-01A-01-BS1.svs/55_20.bmp,0
├── TCGA-10-0928-01A-01-BS1.svs/58_30.bmp,1
│        ⋮
└── TCGA-61-1730-11A-01-TS1.svs/60_10.bmp,0

test.txt
│
├── TCGA-12-1335-01A-01-BS1.svs/38_50.bmp,1
├── TCGA-16-1342-01A-01-BS1.svs/55_20.bmp,0
├── TCGA-30-0928-01A-01-BS1.svs/58_30.bmp,1
│        ⋮
└── TCGA-58-1730-11A-01-TS1.svs/60_10.bmp,0

```


#### 3. Trainining
Open the "solver.py" and "voc_layers.py" files to set up the storage location of training models and the location of training list("train.txt") to use.

Then in a terminal run:
```
python solver.py
```


#### 4. Patch Selection for training
After the training is completed, use the 'Patch_selection' file to select tiles for model selection.

Then in a terminal run:
```
./Patch_selection train.txt
```
After running in a terminal, the .txt results will be produced under the folder '/List' and the filename will be PatchSelection_train.txt.


#### 5. Model Selection
Open the Model_selection.py file to set up the storage location of training models and the location of training list("PatchSelection_train.txt") to use.

Then in a terminal run:
```
python Model_selection.py
```
After running in a terminal, the result will be display on the terminal window, record the model name and Copy it to the folder 'inference/Model'.


#### 6. Data preprocessing for inference
Utilize the 'locate' file to locate the coordinates of noise in the image.

Then in a terminal run:
```
./locate
```
After running in a terminal, the .txt results will be produced under the folder '/List' and the filename will be stain_area.txt. 

Next, use the 'Preprocess' file to remove noise from the tiles.

Then in a terminal run:
```
./Preprocess
```
After running in a terminal, the .txt results will be produced under the folder '/List' and the filename will be Preprocessed.txt. 


#### 7. Patch Selection for inference
Utilize the 'Patch_selection' file to choose the tiles for inference.

Then in a terminal run:
```
./Patch_selection Preprocessed.txt
```
After running in a terminal, the .txt results will be produced under the folder '/List' and the filename will be PatchSelection_test.txt. 


#### 8. Testing
Open the "inference.py" file to set up the storage location of training models and the location of testing list("PatchSelection_test.txt") to use.

Then in a terminal run:
```
python inference.py
```
